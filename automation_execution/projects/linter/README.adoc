= Integration of Ansible Linter with GitHub

In your GitHub repository, create the workflow file:

. Go to the `Actions` tab
. Click the `New workflow` button
. This will create the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file (you can change the name if needed to)

[source,yaml]
----
include::main.yml[]
----

[NOTE]
====
You can customize ansible lint behavior by creating the `.ansible-lint` file or `.ansible-lint.yml` file in your repo root.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
skip_list:
  - no-changed-when
  - var-naming
warn_list:
  - experimental
exclude_paths:
  - roles/test/
  - playbooks/legacy/
verbosity: 1
----
====

I have included the `bad_code.txt` file which contain an ugly playbook with a lot of mistakes. Make a copy of it with a different name and `*.yml` extension and push it to the repo in the `intermediate` branch to trigger the linter verification.

[source,bash]
----
$ git checkout intermediate
$ cp bad_code.txt test1.yml
$ git add test1.yml
$ git commit -m "testing ansible-lint"
$ git push
----

Go to the repo and generate a new `PR` in the GitHub platform and verify how the the `Actions` is triggered!
