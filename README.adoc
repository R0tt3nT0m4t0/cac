= Configuration as Code in AAP 2.5

== About this repo

- This repository is divided following the AAP 2.5 console standards and naming conventions
- It has different levels of complexity separated by branches `basic`, `intermediate` and `advanced` in the repo for demonstration purposes and clarity
- Every section holds a single `main.yml` file to run the configurations and uses a `configurations` folder on every section to separate the actual values

== In the future

- You can expect more and more examples to be included but will try to keep it clean to avoid making it too cumbersome

== What else is there?

- There is a section of tools where I am placing other stuff useful for this purpose but not necessarily CaC related.

== What to do next?

> Grab a coffee and have fun!
